# Scala loan calculator

This project is a small loan calculator that will compute the optimal payback scenario given user defined loans and chosen strategy.



##Parts:
  * linear programming algorithm
    * though the problem turned out to be simple enough to not need linear programming, it was in pursuit of learning the simplex algorithm that I chose this project
  * multiple payoff strategies
    * snowball - pay off smallest loan first
    * avalanche - pay off highest interest rate first
    * fastest payoff - this could require a linear programming algorithm
    * pay the lowest amount - 
  * nice looking front end
    * def the hardest part
  * comprehensive testing
  * visualization dashboard 
    * dynamic pie chart of loans
    * visualizations relevant to different strategies


## TODO
-[ ] Have db not save for too long - (between users?)
-[ ] Calculate loan summaries
-[ ] Display pie chart - use D3
-[ ] Put html in gridded layout
-[ ] Save loan stack for users
