# Scala loan calculator

This project is a small loan calculator that will compute the optimal payback scenario given user defined loans and chosen strategy.

This will be the first larger project I undertake in Scala and is entirely a learning experience.


##Parts:
  * linear programming algorithm
  * multiple strategies
    * least interest
    * fastest payoff
    * cut monthly expenses
  * nice looking front end
  * comprehensive testing

## Learning I want out of this project
  * Get a grip on Scala
  * Get a grip on functional programming
  * Get a grip on testing
  * Get a grip on a web framework 




## TODO
  * Develop forms in lift
    * how to get access to data?
    * restructure page so it looks better
    * dynamically allow more loan inputs
  * Integrate loan model into lift
    * take data from forms and build loans
    * apply stategies
    * display results
  * completely merge and restructure the two projects into one based on lift
    * loan calculator started in one sbt project, building off of lift_base.  merge the two?
  * figure out this testing - 
    * was using the manager.scala - I think I need to use unit tests to be sure I'm developing correctly
