      <h2>About</h2>



<i>This is my very first project using Lift and Scala. 
It was inspired by my large student loans.
</i>
<br>
<br>

To use this loan calculator, input your loans into the fields
and select a strategy you want to use to pay them off.
<br>
<br>


When you press <b>Calculate</b>, the underlying optimization algorithms will 
calculate the best monthly payments you can make to your loans.
<br><br>

The strategies you can choose are:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Snowball</li>
<li>Avalanche</li>
<li>Lazy</li>
</ul>

Sorry, I didn't make up these names.
