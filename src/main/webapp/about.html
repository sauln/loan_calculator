      <h2>About</h2>
<p>
 This is a really cool application designed by Nathaniel Saul.
</p>


<p>
It is his first project using Lift and Scala.  
It has been an interesting learning experience for him, having done very limited web development.  
While the intention of the project was to practice scala, the scala part (actually building the computational aspect of the loan calculator) was really quite simple.  
It was learning the view first paradigm that has (so far) been the most difficult part.  
</p>

<p>
This page not only describes what the project is about, but also shows most of what he knows about HTML (hint: not much).
