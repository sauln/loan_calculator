This project will be the first larger project I undertake in Scala

I intend to build a small loan calculator using modern web framework
  - ideally in a framework that makes using the code for web & app easy.

First, I need to develop the basic structure of MVC - then



Parts:
  linear programming algorithm
  multiple strategies
    least interest
    fastest payoff
    cut monthly expenses
  nice looking front end
  comprehensive testing





In an attempt to think MVC, what are the models?
  each loan
  each strategy
  each payment outcome
    is each payment, or each payment group a model?




user inputs loan information
chooses strategy
optimization happens
output the payment strategy

Eventually, things like user accounts and saving settings - but first, once off
