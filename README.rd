# Scala loan calculator

This project is a small loan calculator that will compute the optimal payback scenario given user defined loans and chosen strategy.

This will be the first larger project I undertake in Scala and is entirely a learning experience.


##Parts:
  * linear programming algorithm
  * multiple strategies
    * least interest
    * fastest payoff
    * cut monthly expenses
  * nice looking front end
  * comprehensive testing

## Learning I want out of this project
  * Get a grip on Scala
  * Get a grip on functional programming
  * Get a grip on testing
  * Get a grip on Play/MVC
